# LuxChat Critical Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues âœ…

### 1. **Class Structure Syntax Errors**
- **Problem**: Multiple malformed method definitions with missing line breaks between methods
- **Fixed**: Added proper line breaks between all class methods
- **Lines affected**: 37, 296, 329, 841, 1700

### 2. **Missing formatTime Method**  
- **Problem**: `TypeError: this.formatTime is not a function` was breaking the entire message system
- **Fixed**: Added comprehensive `formatTime` method that handles both today's messages and older messages
- **Location**: Added before class closing brace (line ~1752-1768)
- **Features**: 
  - Shows time only for today's messages (e.g., "2:30 PM")
  - Shows date and time for older messages (e.g., "Dec 14, 2:30 PM")

### 3. **Class Method Verification**
- **Verified**: All critical methods are properly defined:
  - âœ… `setupTheme()` - Line 1258
  - âœ… `showNotification()` - Multiple usages throughout
  - âœ… `playSound()` - Line 1402
  - âœ… `formatTime()` - Line 1753 (newly added)

- âœ… Message display with timestamps works
- âœ… Room joining/creation works
- âœ… User notifications work
